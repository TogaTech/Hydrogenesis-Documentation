Hydrogenesis is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing DPROGs. DPROGs are programs which are hosted on the Fluidity blockchain and used for a number of purposes related to the Fluidity blockchain, Flow, and any other coins hosted by Fluidity.

Hydrogenesis was influenced by Python and JavaScript and is designed to target the Fluidity Virtual Machine (FVM).

Hydrogenesis is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.

With Hydrogenesis you can create DPROGs for uses such as voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions, and multi-signature wallets.

When deploying DPROGs, you should use the latest released version of Hydrogenesis. This is because breaking changes as well as new features and bug fixes are introduced regularly.
